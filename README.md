Face Mask Detection Platform uses Artificial Network to 
recognize whether a user doesn't wear a mask. Any existing or new IP mask detection cameras can
connect to the app to detect people without a mask. App users may also add faces and phone numbers to warn them in the event
they don't wear a mask. If the camera captures an unrecognized face, an administrator may be sent a notice.

If the face mask detector application identifies a user that he/she was not wearing a mask, AI alerts are sent
with the picture of the person.
It allows the application to run automatically and enforces the wearing of the mask.
